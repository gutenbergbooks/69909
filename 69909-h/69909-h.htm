Few things in general use in the great world
to-day have the hall-mark of approval of two
thousand years set upon them. New materials,
new processes, new commodities have
followed the train of advancing civilization and the ensuing
multiplication and alteration of man’s economic needs.
Even where the demand for a certain material to fulfill
a particular function has continued through the centuries,
widening knowledge of natural resources coupled with
modern invention has usually found some substitute cheaper,
more efficient, and better adapted for the purpose in
question. Not so with cork. Recognized by the ancients
as peculiarly suited for certain uses, time has vindicated
their verdict; nothing has yet been discovered to supplant
it in its wide sphere of usefulness.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp71" id="i_para_a" style="width: 2.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_para_a.jpg" alt="">
</div><p>Theophrastus, Greek philosopher and writer on
botany, who flourished in the fourth century before
Christ, was evidently familiar with the material, for he
mentions the cork tree as being a native of the Pyrenees.
For decades before the time of Horace cork was used for
stoppers for wine vessels. In fact, the poet tells one of
his friends, about 25 B. C., that on the occasion of a coming
anniversary banquet he expects to “remove the cork
sealed with pitch” from a jar of the rare vintage of forty-six
years previous, the first but not the last proceeding of
this character of which history makes record.</p>

</div><p>It remained for the elder Pliny, however, in his wonderful
work on natural history, written in the first century
of the Christian era, to make the most remarkable reference
to cork to be found in ancient literature: “The cork
oak is but a very small tree and its acorns of the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
worst quality * * *; the bark is its only useful
product, being remarkably thick, and if removed will grow
again * * *.</p>

<p>This substance is employed more particularly

and the drag-nets of fishermen; it is used also for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
bungs of casks and as a material for the winter shoes of
women.” Cork jackets—life-preservers—are mentioned by
Plutarch. Thus five of the principal functions which cork
fills in the world to-day were recognized two thousand
years ago. In the fifteenth century glass bottles were introduced,
which gave such great impetus to its general use
that the real beginning of the cork industry may properly
be said to date from that period. Some conception of its
importance to-day may be gathered from the fact that the importations
of the United States of crude and manufactured
cork now aggregate almost $5,000,000 in value annually.</p>

<p>Spain and Portugal divide

raw material is concerned, with perhaps the advantage
leaning slightly to the
latter.</p>

<p>The cork-producing
territory covers
practically the whole of
Portugal, sweeps toward
the east through
the southern districts
of Spain known as Andalusia
and Estremadura,
thence northeast,
embracing thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of acres of forests in Catalonia.</p>

<p>Algeria, with Tunis, ranks
next in importance in yearly tribute of bark, southern
France, including Corsica, following closely after. Italy,
too, with the help of Sardinia and Sicily, continues to be
quite a factor in meeting the demand for the crude material,
while across the Strait of Gibraltar the sun-scorched forests
of Morocco are as yet undeveloped. The total area covered
by cork forests is estimated at from four to five million
acres, while the annual production of bark is declared
to be not far from fifty thousand tons.
Although no official
statistics are obtainable, these figures approximate the
truth. In Portugal and Spain, particularly in Catalonia,
which is probably the greatest cork manufacturing district
in the world, a large portion of the corkwood produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
goes to supply domestic factories, where more and more
machinery is being introduced every year. With these
exceptions, however, the major part of the yield is exported
to the United States, England, France, Germany, Austria,
Russia, Denmark, or Sweden, to be turned into finished form.</p>

</div><p>The cork oak, known botanically as <i>Quercus suber</i>,
attains a height of from twenty to sixty feet and
measures sometimes as much as four feet in diameter. Its
wide-spreading branches are rather closely covered with
small evergreen leaves, thick, glossy, slightly serrated, and
downy underneath. In April or May flowers of a yellowish
color appear, succeeded by acorns which ripen and fall
to the ground in the late fall. Pliny evidently knew whereof
he wrote, for the cork oak’s acorns are bitter and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
at all pleasant to the taste.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp96" id="i_012" style="max-width: 74em;">

  <div class="captionl">Virgin Cork and Second Stripping Bark

</div>

<p>They form, however, one of
the forests’ chief sources of revenue, since, fed to swine,
they give a peculiarly piquant flavor to the meat, Spanish
mountain hams being noted for their excellence. Unfortunately,
the herds in foraging for food destroy the young
trees and thus do serious and permanent injury by preventing
new growth.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp71" id="i_para_a_5" style="width: 2.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_para_a.jpg" alt="">
</div><p>The “corkwood,” or cork of commerce, is the outer
bark of the cork oak. When it has attained a diameter
of approximately five inches, or, to be more exact,
measures forty centimeters in circumference according to
the Spanish governmental regulations, which the tree does
usually by the time it is twenty years old, the virgin cork,
as the first stripping of bark is called, is removed. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
virgin cork is so rough, coarse, and dense in texture that
it is of very little commercial value.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp95" id="i_013" style="max-width: 73.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionr">Cork Bark, “Back” and “Belly”</div>
</div>

<p>Fortunately its removal
does not kill the tree, but, on the other hand, seems
to promote further development, for the inner bark—the
seat of the growing processes—undertakes at once the
formation of a new covering of finer texture.
Each year
this, the real skin, with its life-giving sap, forms two layers
of cells—one within, increasing the diameter of the trunk;
the other without, adding thickness to the sheathing
of bark.
After eight or ten years this is also removed,
and, while more valuable than the virgin cork, it is not as
fine in quality as that of the third and subsequent strippings,
which follow at regular intervals of about nine years.
At the age of about forty years the oak begins to yield its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
best bark, continuing productive as a rule for almost a
century, although cork trees several hundred years old are
not unknown.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Preparing Bark for Carriage to the Boiling Station</div>
</div>

<p>Flourishing as it does in a hot, semi-arid
climate, there seems to be no reason why this valuable tree
should not be successfully introduced
in the southern and
southwestern sections of the
United States; in fact, in the
year 1858 the United States
Government took certain
steps in this direction, and
even went so far as to distribute
seedlings to interested persons
in several states.</p>

  <div class="captionl">Cork under the Microscope</div>

<p>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Civil War interfered, however, and the experiments were
never fully carried out.</p>

</div>
<p>The stripping generally takes place during July and
August, and is a process
which demands skill and care
if injury to the tree is to be
avoided. In Algeria, the French
strippers sometimes use crescent-shaped
saws; but under
the usual Spanish method a
hatchet with a long handle,
wedge-shaped at the end, is the
only implement employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp49" id="i_015_right" style="width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_015_right.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionr">The Common Carrier</div>
</div>

<p>The
bark is cut clear through around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the base of the tree and a similar incision is made around
the trunk just below the spring of the main branches; the
two incisions are then connected by one or two longitudinal
cuts, following so far as possible the deepest of the natural
cracks in the bark.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp98" id="i_016_2" style="max-width: 76.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionl">A Boiling Station</div>
</div>

<p>Inserting the wedge-shaped handle,
the tree’s covering is then pried off, care being taken not to
injure the inner skin at any stage of the process, for the life
of the tree depends on its proper preservation; and if it is
injured at any point, growth there ceases and the spot remains
forever afterward scarred and uncovered.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_016_right" style="width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_016_right.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionr">A Wagon Load of Bark</div>
</div>

<p>The larger branches are
stripped in the same manner,
yielding thinner but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
generally a finer grade of cork than that from the trunk.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp97" id="i_017" style="max-width: 73.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionr">Factory at Seville, covering Twenty Acres</div>
</div>

<p>The thickness of the bark is anywhere from one-half to two
and a half inches, while the yield also varies greatly—from
forty-five to five hundred
pounds—depending on the
size and age of the tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp69" id="i_017_left" style="width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_017_left.jpg" alt="">
</div>

<p>As
the bark is removed it is gathered
up in piles and left for a
few days to dry. Having been
weighed, it is next carried
either in wagons or on the
backs of burros to the boiling
stations, where it is stacked
and allowed to season for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
few weeks. It is then ready for the boiling process, which
at times is postponed until the crude material reaches
Seville or some other
shipping point.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp97" id="i_018" style="max-width: 76.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionl">Trimming the Sheets of Bark at Seville</div>
</div>

<p>But if
the forest is distant, the
water supply adequate,
and the quantity of bark
ample to justify such
procedure, the vats are
erected at a convenient
spot and this operation
carried out on the
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp76" id="i_018_right" style="width: 18.75em;">

</div>

<p>The outside of
the bark in its natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
state is, as may well be imagined, rough and woody, owing
to exposure to the weather.
After boiling, this useless
outer coating is readily scraped off, thereby reducing the
weight of the material almost twenty per cent. The boiling
process also serves to remove the tannic acid, increases the
volume and elasticity of the bark, renders it soft and pliable,

<p>But before the onslaught of a circular steel knife, revolving
hundreds of revolutions every minute and kept at razor-like
sharpness, even this difficulty disappears, and the sheets
are readily cut into strips whose width is determined by the
length of the cork desired.</p>

to cut the corks out as closely together as possible so as
to reduce waste to a minimum. The stoppers which come
from these machines are round with parallel sides. If
tapered corks are desired, larger at the upper end than
at the lower, the cylindrical or “straight” pieces must be
passed through another machine, which handles them deftly,

much of which still

<p>Whole families participate, slicing the bark into

<p>When the further fact is known that

twenty regular besides
numerous special
grades, one can still further
appreciate what the
problem involves. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
work itself calls for such a peculiar combination of faculties
that only one out of every five operatives who are given preliminary
training in this department is found satisfactory;
but so highly skilled do the regular workers become that
the sorting of thirty-five thousand corks may be considered
an average day’s labor.</p>

<p>Experts exercise careful supervision

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_para_a.jpg" alt="">
</div><p>When past the keen eye of the tester, the cork, after
its long journey through the factory, passes either
direct to the packing department or to the warehouses.
This last point involves a problem which is often very
puzzling and difficult of solution. Thousands of dollars’
worth of corks are placed in the warehouses every year to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>

<p>An order for a quantity of corks
of a certain size and quality also involves, of necessity, the
manufacture of a great many corks of other grades. The
reason for this is, of course, found in the fact that the raw
material, no matter how carefully sorted at the outset, will
not produce a finished product of uniform quality. Thus
frequently it becomes necessary to work over a given lot
of corks for which there is no demand into a smaller size for
which orders are pouring in.</p>

</div><p>The many different
grades of granulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
cork, made by grinding up cork waste, find a wide sphere
of usefulness for packing and heat insulating purposes. In this last mentioned field, in fact, cork now ranks preeminent.
Its peculiar structure, which may be seen under
the microscope—myriads of
sealed air cells, impervious to
air and water—renders it not
only a splendid nonconductor
of heat, but also nonabsorbent
of moisture.</p>

<p>For loose filling
between the walls of ice boxes,
water coolers, and cold storage
rooms, and about the
sides of freezing tanks in ice
factories, hundreds of tons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
granulated cork are employed every year.
Comparatively
recently, however, an insulating material possessing permanency
of form has been found desirable for many reasons.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp95" id="i_044" style="max-width: 76em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="captionl">Life-Preserver</div>
</div>

<p>
To meet this demand granulated cork is transformed
into corkboard at the Company’s plants at Beaver Falls,
Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey. Using the pure
cork, either with or without an asphaltic binder, three
grades of this material are made, known as Nonpareil,
Impregnated, and Acme Corkboard, respectively. The
sheets measure twelve by thirty-six inches, of various thicknesses,
and, as they possess ample structural strength, may
be nailed into place in buildings or rooms of frame construction,
or put up with Portland cement against brick,
stone, or concrete walls and ceilings. A plaster finish is
readily applied. Owing to its freedom from progressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
deterioration, its constant efficiency, its slow burning and
fire retarding properties, and its sanitary qualities, corkboard
insulation is now recognized as the standard throughout
the land, and may be found installed almost everywhere
refrigeration is employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp96" id="i_045" style="max-width: 78.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="">

</div>

<p>Hundreds of cold storage warehouses,
abattoirs, fur storage vaults, breweries, ice plants,
dairies, creameries, candy factories, and bakeries are insulated
with it, not to mention refrigerated rooms in
hotels, clubs, private residences, and aboard the ships of
the United States, British, and Italian navies.</p>

<div class="figleft illowp71" id="i_para_a_21" style="width: 2.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_para_a.jpg" alt="">
</div><p>Another by-product, and the last one of importance,
is cork pipe covering for insulating cold pipe lines.
Made of pure granulated cork, slightly compressed and
molded in sectional form to fit the many different sizes of
pipe and kinds of fittings, it is a thoroughly durable covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
for brine and ammonia piping in refrigerating plants,
and for ice water lines in office buildings, hotels, and industrial
establishments.</p>

<p>In this rôle the cork bark, after its
devious career in American factories, performs a service
similar to that of its early days in Spain, when, sheathing
trunk and branches, it prevented the sun’s rays and the
parching winds from heating and drying up the cool, life-giving
sap of its parent tree.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
